# Linear Regression Using Boston Housing Data

This folder contains the Linear Regression Using Boston Housing Data project. 

My solution is located in the file Linear_Regression_Using_Boston_Housing_Data.ipynb

The file should be opened with Jupyter Notebook.

This dataset was taken from the StatLib library which is maintained at Carnegie Mellon University.

The Boston house-price data of Harrison, D. and Rubinfeld, D.L. 'Hedonic
prices and the demand for clean air', J. Environ. Economics & Management,
vol.5, 81-102, 1978.   Used in Belsley, Kuh & Welsch, 'Regression diagnostics
...', Wiley, 1980.   N.B. Various transformations are used in the table on
pages 244-261 of the latter.

The Boston house-price data has been used in many machine learning papers that address regression
problems.
